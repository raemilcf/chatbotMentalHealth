# Chatbot Mental Health
### Team: Mental Health Mavericks

#### Project Oveview:
Mental health is an important element of overall well-being, but many people continue to have inadequate access to mental health services. The increasing prevalence of mental health concerns highlights the importance of accessible and scalable remedies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) offer a unique chance to address this gap by delivering immediate emotional assistance via chatbots. These chatbots use advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to identify and reply to user inputs with empathy and accuracy. This study focuses on creating an NLP-based chatbot to improve mental health by providing strong and consistent emotional support.
