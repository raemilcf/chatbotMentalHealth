#### Overview
Mental health is an important element of overall well-being, but many people continue to have inadequate access to mental health services. The increasing prevalence of mental health concerns highlights the importance of accessible and scalable remedies. Artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) offer a unique chance to address this gap by delivering immediate emotional assistance via chatbots. These chatbots use advanced machine learning techniques such as neural networks with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to identify and reply to user inputs with empathy and accuracy. This study focuses on creating an NLP-based chatbot to improve mental health by providing strong and consistent emotional support.

#### Key Features
Advanced AI Techniques: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning methods, including neural networks with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to deliver accurate and empathetic responses.
High Accuracy: Achieved an impressive accuracy of 86% on the test set, demonstrating the chatbot’s ability to effectively understand and respond to user inputs.
Optimized Performance: Hyperparameter tuning was applied to enhance the model’s performance, ensuring robust and consistent emotional support.

#### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a scalable solution for improving mental health support using AI-driven technologies. By integrating sophisticated NLP techniques, the chatbot aims to offer a reliable and accessible resource for those in need of emotional assistance, helping to mitigate the challenges associated with accessing traditional mental health services.
